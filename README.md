# immersion-tools - Script collection for easier language learning on Linux

This repository combines all the scripts I had to develop for efficient language learning on Linux.
They are probably quite specific to modern Debian/Ubuntu with KDE, so please see them as a source of inspiration rather than a finished product.
That said, the KDE-specific parts (for example) can be easily replaced if you know your own desktop environment decently well!
Most of the core logic will probably work on any modern Linux system.

## Requirements

Please see the header section of each script for any specific requirements.

## Usage

It should be fine to simply drop the scripts you want to use into your system's `/opt/` directory and make them executable.
Call them on specific shortcut presses, execute them as a systemd service on appropriate events or just execute them manually when needed.

## Important

I developed this collection of scripts in the early phases of my own language learning and certainly saved myself a lot of hassle through this.
However, I cannot guarantee that you will be equally satisfied with it.
Please consider creating an issue or a pull request if you know how to do it better.
If my contribution eased your language learning experience or you want me to help you with a specific problem more quickly, consider [donating as much as you feel I deserve](https://www.paypal.me/jojosoft/5)!
